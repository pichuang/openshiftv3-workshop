Using SSL in your application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise you will set up your application to encrypt traffic
with the OpenShift Wildcard certificate.

*Step 1: Switch to an existing project*

For this exercise, we will use an application that we created before. We
will be using the *lab2* that you created in the previous
labs. Make sure you are switched to that project by using the *oc
project* command. *Remember* to substitute UserName.

....
$ oc project lab2
....

*Step 2: View the routing config*

To view the routing config you will need to use the `oc get route`
command

....
$ oc get route/time -o yaml

apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/host.generated: "true"
  creationTimestamp: 2019-08-13T08:59:33Z
  labels:
    app: time
  name: time
  namespace: lab2
  resourceVersion: "53860"
  selfLink: /apis/route.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/lab2/routes/time
  uid: ab159b28-bda8-11e9-bea8-06024d6b2a9c
spec:
  host: time-lab2.apps.pichuang-678b.openshiftworkshop.com
  port:
    targetPort: 8080-tcp
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: time
    weight: 100
  wildcardPolicy: None
status:
  ingress:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2019-08-13T08:59:33Z
      status: "True"
      type: Admitted
    host: time-lab2.apps.pichuang-678b.openshiftworkshop.com
    routerName: router
    wildcardPolicy: None
....

Note here that the `host:` is set to the FQDN that your application is
running on.

Currently the routing component of OpenShift 3 supports ports `80` and
`443`. When you first create your route, the mapping of `80` to your pod
is done automatically. There are a few things that need to be done in
order to get the `443` mapping to work.

*Step 3: TLS Edge Termination*

OpenShift has a _wildcard_ SSL certificate that it can use for any
application. We can use this SSL certificate to serve SSL from our
application without having to generate a cert of our own (which is
sometimes called SSL-offloading).

Edit your routing configuration:

....
oc edit route/time
....

You are going to add `tls: termination: edge` right below the `host:`
section. It should look something like this.

....
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/host.generated: "true"
  creationTimestamp: 2019-08-13T08:59:33Z
  labels:
    app: time
  name: time
  namespace: lab2
  resourceVersion: "53860"
  selfLink: /apis/route.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/lab2/routes/time
  uid: ab159b28-bda8-11e9-bea8-06024d6b2a9c
spec:
  host: time-lab2.apps.pichuang-678b.openshiftworkshop.com
  port:
    targetPort: 8080-tcp
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: time
    weight: 100
  wildcardPolicy: None
status: {}
....

*Step 4: Verify*

Verify by visiting your page by using the `https://` URI

Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learned about service SSL
